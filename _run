./configure should normally be called before this. It is also
rather unlikely you will want to run ./_run - the underscored
file contains variables such as \$\{VAR\} for envsubst; \$\{var:-\}
will not be touched.

Execute either as ./run or, if it is necessary to kill an
already provisioned instance, ./run -k | --kill.
